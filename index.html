    <h2>A little more about me:</h2>
    <p> Hello! My name is Claire and I am a new software developer.
        I am looking forward to a future in a new, interesting industry.
        Previously I created my own small artist business to sell things
        I make. I believe that will give me good soft skills to use in
        this new endeavor.
    </p>
    
    <h3>In conclusion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I am tired at the moment but determined</li>
        <li>I hope to do well</li>
        <li>I look forward to sleeping tonight</li>
    </ul>
